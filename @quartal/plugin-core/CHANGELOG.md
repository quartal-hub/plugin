# @quartal/plugin-core

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- aed3d80: Align plugin outputs with the Agent Plugins 1.0 standard: `GET /plugin.json` serves the standard
  manifest (the Quartal overview moved to `GET /com.quartal.plugin/contents.json`), `GET /mcp.json`
  serves the standard `mcpServers` config, and `GET /plugin.zip` serves the whole installable
  package (dual Claude manifests, skills, agents, README, Quartal extension). MCP list results are
  also mirrored as REST (`GET /mcp/tools.json`, `/mcp/prompts.json`), and a plugin can declare
  multiple named MCP servers — hosted at `/mcp/<name>` or external — via the `mcp.servers` section
  of `qrtl.config`. `@quartal/plugin-core` carries the new manifest and multi-server model types.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 97dc6c5: Baseline release of every published package to verify the upgraded release pipeline
  (changesets/action v2) pushes git tags and creates GitHub Releases on publish.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e4c8a90: Add the `@visibility` JSDoc tag for tools (MCP Apps `_meta.ui.visibility`): `model` and/or `app`
  scopes, advertised in `tools/list` so hosts can hide widget-only helper tools from the model.
  New `McpToolVisibility` type and optional `visibility` on `McpToolDescriptor` / `CodeFunction`.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 3922e86: Remove leftovers from the project's Deno/JSR era.
  
  `@quartal/plugin-core` drops `deno.jsonc` and is now a plain pnpm TypeScript package. Its README
  documents that the package has, and must keep, no runtime dependencies: it sits at the bottom of the
  dependency graph for every other `@quartal` package and is consumed from server, browser, and
  bundler contexts alike.
  
  Documentation and comments across the other packages no longer describe the Deno-era toolchain.
  Published READMEs are affected, hence the version bumps; there are no code changes.
